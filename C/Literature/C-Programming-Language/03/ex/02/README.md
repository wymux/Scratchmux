# Exercise 3-2

- Write a function `escape(s, t)` that converts characters like newline and tab into visible escape sequences like
`\n` and `\t` as it copies the string `t` and `s`. Use a `switch`. Write a function for the other direction as well,
converting escape sequences into the real characters.
